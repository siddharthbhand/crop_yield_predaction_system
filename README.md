# crop_yield_predaction_system
This project is a Machine Learning based Crop Yield Prediction System that helps farmers select suitable crops and predict expected yield using environmental and soil parameters. The system analyzes factors such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK), pH value, rainfall, temperature, humidity, fertilizer usage, and historical crop data. It uses Random Forest for crop recommendation and Linear Regression for yield prediction. The goal of this project is to improve agricultural productivity, support data-driven farming decisions, and reduce risks caused by uncertain environmental conditions.
